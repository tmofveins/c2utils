# c2utils
Rework of my Cytus 2 chart search Discord bot.

Inspired by [Aeriqu's Crobot](https://github.com/Aeriqu/CroBot), another Discord bot used for searching Sound Voltex charts.

Other planned features: bp calculator through OCR

## !c2s <search_key>

This command searches the [Cytus 2 chart viewer website](https://ct2view.the-kitti.com/) and generates a Discord embed containing relevant information of the chart.

### Example usage:

In the case of multiple matches, users are also able to search by the song's ID.

### Planned updates:

__Aliasing feature__: since some songs have Japanese/Chinese titles or titles that are otherwise too long/annoying to type, translations/nicknames for these songs will be added in future so users can search for those instead.
